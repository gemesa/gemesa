## Hey!

I'm Andr√°s G√©mes, a compiler developer at HighTec, Budapest. Previously I have been working as an embedded SW engineer at Knorr-Bremse, Budapest and as a freelancer on Upwork.

## Involvement

I am involved in the following projects:
- [aircrack-ng](https://github.com/aircrack-ng/aircrack-ng) - contributor (submitting patches)
- [OpenWrt](https://github.com/openwrt/openwrt) - contributor (submitting patches)
- [libdeflate](https://github.com/ebiggers/libdeflate) - contributor (submitting patches)
- [libdeflate-nim](https://github.com/gemesa/libdeflate-nim) - maintainer
- [cryptmypi](https://github.com/unixabg/cryptmypi) - contributor (submitting patches)
- [Fedora](https://start.fedoraproject.org/) - contributor (running kernel tests)

Besides that, embedded systems are close to my heart so I always work on some STM32 based side project. Some of them are available here as public repos ([stm32-rf-scanner](https://github.com/gemesa/stm32-rf-scanner), [stm32-dc-dc](https://github.com/gemesa/stm32-dc-dc)).
