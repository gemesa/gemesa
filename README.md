## Hey!

I'm Andr√°s G√©mes, a Rust toolchain developer at HighTec, Budapest. Previously I have been working as an embedded SW engineer at Knorr-Bremse, Budapest and as a freelancer on Upwork.

## Involvement

I am involved in the following projects:
- [aircrack-ng](https://github.com/aircrack-ng/aircrack-ng) and [aircrack-ng Wiki](https://www.aircrack-ng.org/doku.php) - contributor
- [8821au](https://github.com/morrownr/8821au-20210708) - contributor
- [Monitor_Mode](https://github.com/morrownr/Monitor_Mode) - contributor
- [cryptmypi](https://github.com/unixabg/cryptmypi) - contributor
- [Fedora](https://start.fedoraproject.org/) - contributor
- [libdeflate-nim](https://github.com/gemesa/libdeflate-nim) - maintainer

Besides that, embedded systems are close to my heart so I always work on some STM32 based side project. Some of them are available here as public repos ([stm32-rf-scanner](https://github.com/gemesa/stm32-rf-scanner), [stm32-dc-dc](https://github.com/gemesa/stm32-dc-dc)).
